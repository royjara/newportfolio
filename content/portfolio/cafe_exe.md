:see_no_evil: Collab w/ [Isabel Angulo](https://www.instagram.com/ninfadetaller/)

Made with: Touchdesigner, Quartz Composer, Ableton, Adobe Premiere

After months under lockdown due to Covid, the daily routine becomes unbearable. We created this video to symbolize our remote relationship through our digital connections. These include glitch art, whatsapp messages (processed into the background noise), the daily cup of coffee, and anime.

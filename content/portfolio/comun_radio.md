Comun Radio is a community radio based in Lima, Peru. It was established in May 2021.

This radio is driven by musicians, and it is intended for fellow music lovers. This is why a modern platform with high fidelity audio was needed.

Inspired by fellow community radios gaining traction globally, I decided to use a cloud provider for high availability, ease of development, and ability to scale as our audience grows.

The radio front end was developed using readymag, a russian no-code platform capable of producing beautiful website. In order to extend readymag's capabilities, we also injected custom javascript code to add radio functionality and make it more dynamic.

The radio backend consists of a bundle of open source technologies, including liquidsoap, icecast as well as MariaDB and a webclient for scheduling shows and managing content.

Disclaimer: This project is still a work in progress.

My upcoming work includes:

- Scripts for auto-editing audio and video.
- Scripts for automatically populating content (youtube, soundcloud)
- UX/UI improvements for a more cohesive navigation.
- Calendar and schedule views on the frontend.

For a short while in October 2021 I became one of those people who are paranoid about the mass surveillance state we're currently living under. 

It all started when I started reading this book called __The Age of Surveillance Capitalism__ by __Shoshana Zuboff__. 


Ideas:

- what is it?
- why should we care?
- sousveillance
- web3

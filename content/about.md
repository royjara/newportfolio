### Master's student @ UCLA in the Electrical Engineering department

I'm seeking to accelerate the ethical distribution of new technologies to people who feel averse to computers. In particular, industries in less developed countries and creatives everywhere!

### Main engineering interests:

- Embedded software
- Internet of Things
- Machine Learning
- Human Computer Interaction
- Digital Signal Processing
- Audio & Speech

I am proficient with computers and many digital tools, I won't list them here. But know that I can easily learn stuff I don't know :P.

Currently Seeking : *Summer Internship*

### Languages

- English
- Spanish
- French (Intermediate)
- German (Beginner)

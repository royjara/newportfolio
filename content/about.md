<h3><mark>Currently Seeking : <strong>Summer Internship</strong></mark></h3>

### Master's student @ UCLA in the Electrical Engineering department

I'm seeking to accelerate the ethical distribution of new technologies to people who feel averse to computers. In particular, industries in less developed countries and creatives everywhere!

- Internet of Things
- Machine Learning

I am proficient with computers and many digital tools, I won't list them here. But know that I can easily learn stuff I don't know :P.

### Work Experience

- Architectural Audio
- Cloud Solutions

### Languages

- English
- Spanish
- French (Intermediate)
- German (Beginner)
